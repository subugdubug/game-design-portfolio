### A Realistic 3D Recreation of Tel Aviv's Rabin Square with Dynamic Combat

**Rabin Square Simulator** is a 3D third-person game set in the iconic Rabin Square of Tel Aviv. This project serves as a showcase of my abilities in worldbuilding, level design, and learning Unreal Engine 5.

**Core Gameplay and Features:**
- **Exploration:** Walk around a 1:1 scale digital recreation of Rabin Square, featuring realistic assets and detailed environments.
- **Melee Combat:** Engage in humorous melee combat using a baguette as a weapon.
- **AI Enemies:** Fight against robot enemies with advanced AI that can chase the player and navigate the environment.

**Easter Egg:**
During playtesting, I noticed that the architecture of the city hall building, combined with the player's ultra-human jumping ability, made it fun and challenging to reach the top by jumping between windows. To reward players who attempt this, I added a fun Easter egg: a picture of a cat with the text "Congratulations" visible only from above on top of the building.

## Role and Contributions
I was solely responsible for the entire project, encompassing all aspects from design to implementation. This includes worldbuilding, level design, and integrating various assets. I used external models, meshes, and animations, which I modified using Blender to fit the project.

## Art Style and Theme
The game adopts a realistic visual style, utilizing assets from the real world and Epic Games' Quixel Bridge Megascans. The environment is meticulously crafted to mirror the actual Rabin Square in a 1:1 scale.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Realistic Exploration:** Players can explore Rabin Square, experiencing the environment with ultra-human abilities like high-speed movement, high jumps, and Naruto-style sprinting.
- **Dynamic Combat:** Engage in melee combat with AI-driven robot enemies that exhibit complex behaviors and pathfinding capabilities.

## Level Design
The level design focuses on an accurate digital recreation of Rabin Square, including:
- **Fountain with Water Physics:** Implemented using Unreal Engine's water systems to replicate the real fountain.
- **City Hall Building:** Detailed recreation with an iconic custom lighting system to match the real-world counterpart.
- **Open Spaces:** Designed to facilitate dynamic combat interactions with a focus on player mobility and enemy AI engagement.

## Technical Achievements
- **AI Systems:** Developed complex AI behaviors for NPCs, including state machines for player and enemy animations.
- **Lighting Challenges:** Overcame significant challenges in achieving realistic lighting and reflections to enhance immersion.

## Development Status
Currently, development on Rabin Square Simulator is paused as I focus on deeper gameplay mechanics for my other project, Malshin Turbo. Future plans may include adding objectives and transforming it into a wave shooter/combat game with increasing difficulty levels.

## Audio and Music
As this project was primarily a technical and artistic showcase, no audio or music has been implemented yet. The focus was on visual fidelity and gameplay mechanics.
