### A Cyberpunk Side-Scroller: Clean the Streets and Fight Crime.

**Malshin Turbo** (working title) is a dystopian side-scroller where you play as a city inspector fed up with the decay of his city. With trash littering the streets and crime rampant, itâ€™s your mission to restore order.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Clean up the trash.**
- **Combat criminals.**

## Role and Contributions
I collaborated with a fellow game developer on this project. My responsibilities included game design, level design, combat mechanics, trash collection mechanics, and balancing. My partner focused on the technical implementation of these features.

## Art Style and Theme
The game features pixel art with dark cyberpunk themes, immersing players in a world where hope is scarce and public spaces are neglected. As players navigate through the level, they encounter progressively challenging enemies with diverse skills, requiring strategic approaches to combat.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Trash Collection:** Players pick up trash with a weight limit and earn points by disposing of it in dumpsters.
- **Shops:** Scattered throughout the level, shops allow players to spend points to restore health, buy power-ups, increase trash carrying capacity, and purchase performance-enhancing drugs for improved combat and speed.

## Level Design
Starting with pre-made assets, I refined the game's visual elements using Aseprite to ensure cohesive pixel art that aligns with the cyberpunk aesthetic. Each level is meticulously designed to enhance the gameplay experience and challenge the player progressively.

## Audio and Music
Working with a professional recording artist and sound engineer, we created original music and sound effects, including retro-futuristic audio and an 8-bit inspired soundtrack that complements the game's atmosphere.

## Development Status
Currently in its early stages, the project is evolving through continuous playtesting. We are refining and redesigning systems to better understand and enhance the core gameplay experience, ensuring it captivates and retains player interest.
